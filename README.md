# Deep Learning Applications in NLP and Computer Vision

This project demonstrates applications of Neural Networks in both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). It combines a Question Answering system built using Hugging Face Transformers with a Conditional GAN (cGAN) for digit generation, showcasing practical deep learning techniques across multiple domains.
